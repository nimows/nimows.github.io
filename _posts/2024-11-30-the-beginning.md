In 2012, I was in my Seattle apartment flying a cargo plane around an ARMA map dreaming of this, at the time, impossibly vast game idea.

Fifteen years later it begins.

I'm Nigel.
I'm 37 and I live in the pacific northwest, USA.
Two years ago I went back to college and I'm third year of earning a Physics/Astronomy undergraduate.
Two years from now I hope to be in Europe working on grad/PhD astrophysics.

Life is a complex machine, and I've always imagined a game studio would eventually be a part of it.

The light from stars has been travelling for millions of years only to have perfectly timed its arrival with you looking up for a brief moment, just in time to catch that light that came all this way.
So, really, fifteen years isn't much time at all. No time like the present. Let's get it on.
